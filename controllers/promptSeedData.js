        materials: ['large sheet of paper', 'washable paints', 'brushes', 'comic books', 'old magazines', 'glue', 'scissors'],
        instructions: 'First get an oversized piece of watercolor paper. It doesn’t have to be oversized, but in this case big is really fun, plus it gives you plenty of space to work and create with. Get out your favorite watercolor set and enjoy some time painting all over the paper. Our favorite way to make watercolor art is with a partner. Ask a family member, babysitter or friend to sit down with you and help you paint. Pick your favorite colors or go for all the colors. Have fun collaborating together. Take turns or paint side by side. Let your watercolor dry completely. If you have a sunny spot nearby, this usually takes no more than ten minutes or so. If you have a young child, 2-4, you can precut images for them. Make a bunch so they have a nice amount to choose from. If your child is older, invite them to sort through a book and cut out their favorite images. You can use comic books, magazines, picture books, anything your child might find interesting. Set out the images next to the watercolor paper with the craft glue and invite your child to glue the images onto the watercolor. Collage can tell a story, reflect a mood, and open up your imagination. It is a great project to do independently or with a friend. There is no right or wrong to collage. It’s a free form craft, which is high on my list of awesome things to do with kids. Oh, and of course framing your child’s masterpiece is always a special treat. Have fun!',

        instructions: 'Cut the cardboard into rectangles approximately 4" x 2". Cut "teeth" of various shapes and sizes, with varied distance between them, into the cardboard rectangles to make "combs". Squeeze a little bit of acrylic paint onto your work surface/placemat and allow your child to begin spreading it around. Give them the combs to see what kind of impressions the different ones make in the paint. You can place the paper on top of designs your child likes and wants to keep and see how the paper picks up those impressions!',
